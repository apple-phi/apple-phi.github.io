They put me in a room.

Afflicted by COVID-19---asymptomatic but for a sore throat---
I suddenly found myself stuck in isolation until a lateral flow test dictated otherwise.
Naturally, I roped in two friends to join me in bunking off the catch-up schoolwork I was supposed to be doing to take part in a game jam.

For me, it was that, or do online shopping and watch all eight seasons of *Brooklyn Nine-Nine* in one sitting (again).

At the time I was a staff member of tbe [Python Discord](https://pydis.org) community, and I had been meaning to take part in a [PyWeek](https://pyweek.org/33/) for a while. So why not.

We ended up starting work on the game a couple days late. But no matter, we finished on time. After being judged against the other 13 entries, we were awarded the top spot for our retro sci-fi puzzle game.

We were quite pleased that many judges couldn't beat all the levels!
